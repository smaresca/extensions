# Officially Supported Extensions
The extensions here are maintained, tested, and supported by Infocyte.

## Approved
These extensions have been tested on multiple Operating Systems and deployed across many enviroments:
- [Collection] Yara_Scanner
- [Collection] EDiscovery
- [Action] Host_Isolation 
- [Action] Host_Isolation_Restore
- [Action] Memory_Dump
- [Collection] Powerforensics_MFT

## Test
These are currently in testing or have only had limited exposure. Review the code and use at your own risk. Ask the author for any limitations that they are aware of. While extensions are designed to fail gracefully if they do fail, be aware that any use of os.execute() or os.popen() within an extension can be arbitrarily powerful and cause changes to systems performed done incorrectly.
